Julie could turn things into gold by her glance for anyone who could make her happy or impress her. From that day, everything they did was just to impress Julie. <br> First they tried to impress her with poems. John wrote a long poem, Harry wrote a longer poem, and Graham wrote the longest poem in the whole world.",                
                      "Then they tried music. <br>John played a loud guitar, Harry played a louder trumpet, and Graham played the loudest drum in the whole world. <br> <br>Then they decided to show off their engineering skills. John made a fast go kart, Harry made a faster go kart, and Graham made the fastest go kart in the whole world.",
                      "In the first part of the story, we read that the three friends thought that Julie was the <i style='color:blue'>quirkiest</i> girl in the world. <br> <br>It seems that they compared Julies‚Äôs personality to the personality of all other girls in the world before coming to this conclusion. <br> <br>When a quality- negative, neutral or positive seems to top the list of your selections, <u style='color:red'>Superlative adjectives</u> are used to express that.",
                      "If Julie‚Äôs personality had not been compared to anybody else‚Äôs personality the three friends could have just said: <br> <i style='color:blue'>Julie is a quirky girl.</i> <br> <br>So we can see that the <i style='color:red'>positive degree</i> of comparison is used to define the quality of a noun, when there is <u>no comparison </u> of that quality of another noun.

                      "If the three friend‚Äôs had compared Julie‚Äôs personality with someone else‚Äôs beauty, then they would have said: <i style='color:blue'>Julie is quirkier than Sara. </i> <br><br>Julie is superior in having a quirky personality than Sara. Thus, we can see that the comparative degree of comparison is used to express a superior and specific difference between two nouns. <br>We must keep in mind that while using the <u style='color:red'>‚Äòcomparative degree adjectives‚Äô</u> in sentences we must use the word ‚Äòthan‚Äô otherwise we will not be able to form the sentence.",

So John bought a big present, Harry bought a bigger present, and Graham bought the biggest present in the whole world, and they all arrived nice and early and ready to impress, but Julie's garden was small, her cottage was smaller, and her door was the smallest on the street, so there was no space for huge presents, for juggling, for go karts, or for guitars, trumpets and drums. <br>There was room for poems, but not for poems as long as John‚Äôs, Harry‚Äôs and Graham‚Äôs.",
